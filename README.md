# Work Experience
&nbsp;
## - Keyboard Designer

- 2016 - Present

In 2016 I began designing a custom mechanical keyboard. I did freelancing work for TheVan Keyboards in which I designed their 2nd     flagship keyboard, the BananaSplit60. During that time I collaborated with artists, worked on R&D, ran the social media platforms, and    acquired deals with varying manufacturers. To this day we have ran two successful groupbuys with an approximate 300 units sold. I am    still designing and working on future projects with the same people.
